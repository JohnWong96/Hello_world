----------Data Analysis Questions---------------------

--1)How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;

--2)What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

SELECT DATE_TRUNC ('month',start_date) AS start_of_month,COUNT(s.plan_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
	ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
WHERE plan_name ='trial'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

--3)What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

SELECT plan_name,COUNT(s.plan_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
	ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
WHERE start_date > '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY  plan_name;

--4)What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

SELECT COUNT(customer_id), 
ROUND((COUNT(customer_id) *100)::DECIMAL/((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)::DECIMAL),1) 
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions s
JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
	ON s.plan_id=p.plan_id
WHERE s.plan_id=4;

--5)How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

SELECT COUNT(customer_id),ROUND((COUNT(customer_id) *100)::DECIMAL/((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)::DECIMAL),0) 
FROM(
SELECT customer_id,start_date,plan_id,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS rank
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions) AS rank_table
WHERE plan_id=4 AND rank=2;

--6)What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

SELECT plan_id,COUNT(customer_id),
ROUND((COUNT(customer_id) *100)::DECIMAL/((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)::DECIMAL),1)
FROM(
SELECT customer_id,start_date,plan_id,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS rank
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions) AS rank_table
WHERE rank=2
GROUP BY plan_id;

--7)What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?

SELECT plan_id,COUNT(customer_id),ROUND((COUNT(customer_id) *100)::DECIMAL/((SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)::DECIMAL),1)
FROM
(SELECT customer_id,start_date,plan_id,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date DESC) AS rank
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE start_date<'2021-01-01') AS rank_table
WHERE rank=1
GROUP BY plan_id;
--8)How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?


SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id=3 AND start_date <'2021-01-01';

--9)How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

CREATE TEMP TABLE annual_plan_start_date AS
SELECT *
FROM
(SELECT customer_id,start_date,plan_id,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS rank
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id=0 OR plan_id=3) AS rank_table
WHERE rank=2;

CREATE TEMP TABLE join_date AS
SELECT *
FROM
(SELECT customer_id,start_date,plan_id,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS rank
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id=0 OR plan_id=3) AS rank_table
WHERE rank=1;

SELECT AVG(apsd.start_date-jd.start_date)
FROM annual_plan_start_date apsd
JOIN join_date jd
	ON apsd.customer_id=jd.customer_id;


--10)Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)

SELECT COUNT(customer_id)
FROM 
(SELECT (apsd.start_date-jd.start_date)::NUMERIC AS time_diff,apsd.customer_id
FROM annual_plan_start_date apsd
JOIN join_date jd
	ON apsd.customer_id=jd.customer_id) AS temp_tabel
GROUP BY 
CASE 
	WHEN time_diff>0 AND time_diff<31 THEN '0-30'
    WHEN time_diff>30 AND time_diff<61 THEN '31-60'
    ELSE 'etc'
END ;

--11)How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
