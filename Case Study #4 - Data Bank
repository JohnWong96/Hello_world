------A. Customer Nodes Exploration----------

--1)How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?

SELECT COUNT(num_nodes) AS unique_node_count
FROM
(SELECT region_id,node_id,COUNT(*) AS num_nodes
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
GROUP BY region_id,node_id) AS node_table;

--2)What is the number of nodes per region?

SELECT region_id,COUNT(node_id) AS node_count
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
GROUP BY region_id;

--3)How many customers are allocated to each region?

SELECT region_id,COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes
GROUP BY region_id;

--4)How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?

--------I found out the date_diff are unusually high and inspect through the data and found out that some data end_date are stored as '9999-12-31' and I assume that date refer to current date. Thus I update the said end date to current date------

UPDATE data_bank.customer_nodes
SET end_date= CURRENT_DATE
WHERE end_date>'2099-01-01';

SELECT AVG(end_date-start_date)AS date_diff
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;

--5)What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?

SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY (end_date-start_date)) AS median,
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.8) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY (end_date-start_date)),
PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY (end_date-start_date))
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes;
